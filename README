Library for reading environment variable files

IMPORTANT! I'm too lazy to write how to install the library :) 
so you'll figure it out yourself, you're not dumb, right?

There's only one function you can use ->

    int loadenv(const char* dotenv_file_path, int overwrite_if_exists)

Also, keep in mind that everything is written in a very compact way, 
and there are bugs, which I'll probably fix someday if I'm not too lazy. 
Maybe. But anyway, it works with pointers, there are no memory leaks, 
everything seems fine and somewhat optimized. For testing, you can run 
the following command if you're using Linux ->

    source libdotenv_build.sh -c

This will run the check and build the example located in the `example/` 
folder. The argument can be either `-c` or `--check`, but you'll figure 
it out.

In general, the project is extremely small. I just put it together in an 
evening when I was bored. So, that's how it turned out.
